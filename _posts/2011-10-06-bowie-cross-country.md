With two meets remaining before district, the Bowie cross-country team aims to qualify for the regional meet in November in Arlington. The Bulldogs runners have competed at the AISD Invitational, St. Andrew’s Invitational and the Cedar Park invitational. Coach Rita Gonzalez will guide her crew at this weekend’s Westlake Chaparral Invitational and next week’s Run at the Ridge at Vista Ridge before the district meet Oct. 28th at Walter E. Long Park in east Austin.

Aaron Davis finished sixth at the AISD meet in August and has been the leading boys runner for Bowie at all three meets. Michael Orlando, Billy Wegeng, Justin Cabello and Travis Bloomfield also consistently compete at the top of the team. Victor Hernandez, John Evans, Evan Stoll, Chris Muyshondt and Travis Barton complete the Bowie boys cross-country roster.

On the girls side, Casey Stanley consistently finishes first among Lady Dawg runners. Sarah Boles, Elise Westmoreland and freshman Keely Peen contribute to the success of the squad. Alisa Hoban, Nicole Coots, Paz Zisman, Victoria Saenz, Lauren Cabello and Cindy Coots round out the female contingent.
