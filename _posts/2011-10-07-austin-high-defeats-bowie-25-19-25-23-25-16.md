After defeating rival Bowie at a tournament earlier in the year, Austin High topped the Lady Dawgs 25-19, 25-23, 25-16 Tuesday evening in a district showdown. “It felt really great,” Lady Maroons outside hitter Wren Overesch said afterward. “We’ve struggled with Bowie in the past. A lot has changed—changed for the better.”

Wes Sigmon, Kate Brodnax, Blair Barnes, Torre Blake and Carly Johnson joined Overesch in the starting lineup for the home team. Bowie began the match with Haley Bianco, Maya Fisher, Selina Giffin, Jamie Ludwig, Kellen Dunn and Cassidy Vaughn on the floor for coach Jason Landers.

With Ludwig serving, Bowie built a 9-2 advantage as Shauntia Carr produced kill shots and Vaughn blocked well at the net. Austin began to move in front 15-13 when Blake provided a kill. An ace by Blake helped the Lady Maroons take the first game 25-19. “It’s a big win for our team,” coach Thomas Kane said. “The girls really worked hard and played through the emotions of playing a rival.”

A perfectly placed kill by Bianco tied the second game 4-4 before a kill by Ludwig put the Lady Dawgs on top 11-10. Blake later took an outstanding angle on a lethal kill shot to give Austin High a 21-20 advantage. Following a Bowie timeout, Blake’s serves enabled the Lady Maroons to close out the Lady Dawgs 25-23 in the second game.

Five straight tremendous serves from Overesch finished off the visitors 25-16 in the final game. “All eyes were on me,” the 5’11” junior acknowledged. “It was a lot of pressure. I just served aggressively and hoped for the best.” Austin High visits Akins on Friday while Bowie entertains Del Valle.
