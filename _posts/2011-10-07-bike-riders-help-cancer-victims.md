Have You Heard…about “Mamma Jamma?” My daughter, Susan Nelms, hit me up for a donation for her participation in a marathon bicycle ride to benefit breast cancer victims. October is “Breast Cancer Awareness Month.” The fund goal was $500,000 and the proceeds are distributed to 11 local charities, such as The Breast Cancer Resources Center, Lance Armstrong’s LiveStrong Cancer Navigation Center, Seton Cancer Screening and Care, and others. There were about 600 riders from all over Austin and across Texas, including some riders from Oak Hill. The distances were varied, from 13 miles to 27 miles, to 45 miles, 70 miles and 100 miles. Each rider solicited donations to motivate them when riding the distance. My daughter Susan raised $7600. Since the first Mamma Jamma bike ride, it has raised an unbelievable one million dollars for cancer victims.

The ride started and ended at Reunion Ranch in Georgetown. At the finish line were a bunch of supporters who rang cowbells, noisemakers and launched bubbles as each rider finished. Many businesses sponsored teams such as United Lending team with my daughter and her husband’s team, who raised over $28,000. Many teams were simply a bunch of folks who banded together, and some wore super-hero and other costumes, and all had specially-designed T-shirts to identify their teams. It also turns out that my son-in-law, Tommy Nelms, is a horse. He decided to ride only at the last minute with almost no practice. In fact he had to rent a bike, but he rode the 100 mile course, and fairly easily.

All this for a good cause, and you too can still participate until the end of the month by donating to www.mammajammaride.org. One of the organizers, Jan Hill, promised that 100 percent of the proceeds go to the eleven local groups. A good cause and it’s all local.

Have You Heard…about the Women’s Marine Association? Neither have I, and I served in the Marine Corps. But, the association exists, and this past Sunday, The Heart of Texas, Chapter V of the Women’s Marine Association was officially installed at the VFW post in Oak Hill. The group has only been meeting for a few months but is growing at a healthy rate. The only qualification for becoming a member is to be a woman and have served, or presently be serving, in the Marine Corps.

The purpose of the group is to allow women with common experiences to get together in a social setting. The group also participates in various community activities and they provide support for any veteran, regardless of sex or branch of service, who needs assistance with dealing with financial, emotional or medical issues. Additionally, they advise “Molly Marines” who are female ROTC members who excel academically and are engaged in various campus organizations.

The new chapter was officially installed in a ceremony led by the Area Director, Maria Crowle, and the president of the Oak Hill chapter, Cyla Huber. There are chapters across the country and even abroad. This is the fifth chapter located in Texas.

The group is sponsored by the Oak Hill VFW Post 4443 and they meet on the first Sunday of the month at the VFW site on Thomas Springs Road, just off Rt. 71 a couple miles from the “Y” at Oak Hill. For more information call the VFW at 288-4443 or visit the web site at www.womenmarines.org. Note, the Marine Corps Ball this year will be held in San Antonio on October 22 instead of the actual date of November 10th.

Thought for the day…I’ve planned well. I have enough money to last the rest of my life – as long as I die by next Tuesday.
