Budget cuts have reduced the number of Crockett cross-country meets to five this year, but the Cougar runners remain a threat to advance to the regional meet. “LBJ is real strong. They are probably the team to beat,” coach Don Holland said. “We should be looking to be in the top three teams in district.” The team competes on Saturday at the Westlake Invitational at Walter E. Long Park in east Austin.

Freshmen Brandon Gonzales and Sergio Reynoso have run well for Holland this semester. “Brandon has got one of the fastest times in district,” the coach added. “Sergio is dedicated and works really hard.” Ian Ferrier, a transfer from New York, also runs for the brown and gold after sitting out last year.

Skyla Camacho highlights the female Cougar runners after qualifying for the regional meet in 2010. “If she can get in the fourteens, she’ll qualify again,” Holland noted. Stephanie Ford consistently lowers her time at each meet. “She’s really improved her times on the year,” the coach added. In three weeks the team competes at the district meet, also at Long Park.
