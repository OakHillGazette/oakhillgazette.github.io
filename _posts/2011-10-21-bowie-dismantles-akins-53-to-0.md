Led by four solo tackles from linebacker Jason Disney, Bowie blanked Akins 53-0 Friday night at Burger Stadium. Seven Bulldogs found the end zone as the black and red crew remained unbeaten in district competition with three regular season games remaining. Bowie (4-3, 2-0) faces Austin High (1-6, 1-1) Friday at Burger while Akins (0-6, 0-2) seeks an initial victory of the year at Anderson.

</div>John Subia converted his lone reception of the evening into a 58-yard scoring play down the middle of the field to give Bowie an early lead over the Eagles. Quarterback Robbie Dickey then threw the first of his three touchdowns strikes on the night to Railond Mayes. Dillon Bolt’s defensive intensity on the back end at the safety spot led to the senior defender accumulating five total tackles in the game.

In the second quarter, Dontae Harris took a direct snap and bolted across the goal line for a score before Call Casarez snagged a 27-yard touchdown reception to give Bowie a 28-0 advantage at intermission. Nygel McCloud scored on a 10-yard run in the third period and Gino Joassaint’s 61-yard dash down the sideline set up a Casarez field goal. The speedy Jonassaint finished with 121 yards on 19 carries.

</div>Up 38-0, senior defensive back Daniel Sanchez made an outstanding special teams tackle on a kick off. Bowie’s reserves got on the board in the fourth quarter as quarterback Brandon Tibbles added a 30-yard touchdown jaunt and Wes Higgins dove into the end zone on 1–yard run. As a team, Bowie rushed 42 times for 306 yards.

The Bulldogs now entertain rival Austin High Friday night at Burger for Homecoming. Having faced the Maroons since 1988, Bowie owns a 15-8 advantage in the annual series. Coach Jeff Ables is aware of the explosive potential of Maroon wide receiver Cayleb Jones. “They have a good receiver that’s a big difference maker,” the coach noted. “We’ve got to keep him from making the big play.”
