Finishing second at the District 15-5A cross-country meet last Saturday with a time of 15:56, Bowie junior Aaron Davis secured a spot at the Region II meet this weekend in Arlington. “He’s been in great shape and form since August,” coach Rita Gonzalez said. “I can’t wait to see him next year.”

Born in Austin, Aaron attended Hyde Park Middle School where he also played football and basketball. He credits his eighth grade basketball coach Devin Olivera for encouraging him to run. “I asked him ‘should I play basketball or run track?’ and he said ‘do what you love, and that’s what’s best for you’. So I ran track,” Davis said. During the spring Aaron competes on the Bulldogs track team running in the 800, mile and 4 x 400 events.

World history instructor Mr. Garcia is Aaron’s favorite teacher at Bowie. “He made things more fun to pay attention to and learn,” Davis noted. The youngest of six children born to Charles and Janelle Davis, Aaron hopes to attend either UT-Arlington or TCU after graduating. Aaron’s older sister Anne played volleyball at Bowie.

Aaron’s favorite athletic moment occurred last weekend when he won a silver medal at Walter E. Long Park in east Austin. “I love that course,” he added. “I know when to kick it in. It was the first time I broke 16 on a 5k course. I knew I’d be pushed more.” Davis has important advice for younger athletes aspiring to run at the varsity level in high school. “Track and field isn’t the most exciting thing, but it’s got to be something you love if you’re going to excel in it,” he said.
