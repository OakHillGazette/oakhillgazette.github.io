McCallum def. Crockett 25-9, 23-25, 28-30, 25-20, 15-10

Despite recovering from a first game loss, the Crockett volleyball team was denied the school’s first outright district championship Friday, as McCallum posted a 25-9, 23-25, 28-30, 25-20, 15-10 victory over the Lady Cougars at Burger Gym. The brown and gold crew bowed out of the Class 4A playoffs on Tuesday in a 25-13, 25-21, 27-25 loss to Vista Ridge.

McCallum jumped out to an early lead and cruised to a 25-9 victory in the first game. Cierra Mullins closed out the Lady Knights with a kill shot following three consecutive aces by DJ Yanes to help Crockett prevail in the second game 25-23. Miscommunication on the back line by Crockett kept McCallum close in the third game, but strategically placed returns by Yanes helped Crockett capture the game 30-28.

The Lady Cougars fell into a 9-1 hole in the fourth game as McCallum began to regain momentum. Kelsey Waugh’s slicing kill down the line reduced the Knight lead to 11-8. A kill from Samantha Gonzalez tied the game 14-14 but McCallum prevailed 25-20.

Three straight aces by Alyssa Pagan put Crockett in command early in the fourth and final game. The Lady Cougars served into the net twice to squash any momentum gained earlier and McCallum seized the moment finish off Crockett 15-10.
