Bulldog running back Gino Jonassaint (#33) -photo: Dudley Hawthorne

Behind an efficient offense, Bowie (5-3, 3-0) built an early lead and cruised to a 41-0 homecoming rout of rival Austin High (1-6, 1-2) Friday evening, October 21 at Burger Stadium. Quarterback Robbie Dickey connected on ten of his dozen throws and the Bulldogs gained 245 yards on the ground.

“The O-line executed well and our receivers and running backs made some big plays,” Bowie co-offensive coordinator Ty Branyon said. “I was proud of the way our offense executed consistently throughout the night.”

Linemen Nick Harrison, Bryce Luster, Dominic Arocha, Eric Sikes and Will Hopkins moved Maroon defenders for Bulldog running back Gino Jonassaint and protected Dickey throughout the evening. With the Bowie running game operating effectively, Dickey faked a hand-off and found receiver Railond Mayes for a 4-yard play action touchdown less than four minutes into the game. Nygel McCloud extended the Bowie advantage on a 19-yard scoring run with 4:12 remaining in the first period.

Tyler Walker’s interception gave Bowie the ball and more momentum in the second quarter. Taking a direct snap, Dontae Harris then scored the first of his three rushing touchdowns. Call Casarez added a touchdown reception in the fourth quarter to cap the Bowie scoring. Mayes led all Bulldog receivers with 63 yards on four catches. Bowie defenders denied Austin High linemen Amir Khodadadi, David Martin, Dylan Utzman, Kel Castro and Ernest Torrez the ability to create space for Maroon running back Quince Reese to make plays.

Defensively, Bowie disrupted the visitor’s offense with sound tackling on the perimeter from Kurt Clark and aggressive pursuit from the secondary by safety Harris. Five-star recruit and University of Texas commit wide-out Cayleb Jones was held in check for most of the contest due in part to intelligent strategy by the Bowie defensive staff which had Mayes shadow the playmaking Maroon receiver to keep him out of the end zone.

Bowie faces nemesis Anderson (5-3, 2-1) Friday at House Park. The Bulldog defense, fresh off a pair of shutdowns, must continue to maintain intensity with a district title game versus Westlake (6-2, 3-0) looming on November 4th. “We’ve got to take care of Anderson first,” coach Jeff Albes said. “They do a good job of running their offense and their defense.”
