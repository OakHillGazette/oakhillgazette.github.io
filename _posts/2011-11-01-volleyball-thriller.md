Austin High def. Bowie 25-20, 25-18, 18-25, 18-25, 15-13

In a thrilling battle for second place in District 15-5A, Austin High topped Bowie 25-20, 25-18, 18-25, 18-25, 15-13 on the road Friday, October 21 at Bowie’s gym.

“It was a tough match,” Lady Maroon skipper Thomas Kane said afterward. “It was what I expect when Bowie plays Austin High. Bowie played really hard and made some adjustments and made us uncomfortable.”

Kane’s crew completed the district schedule on Tuesday disposing of Akins 25-3, 25-18, 25-5 at home.

With assists from Kate Brodnax and kills from Wren Overesch, Austin High quickly won the first two games 25-20 and 25-18 as Torre Blake delivered a pair of late kills to secure the second game. Blake’s serving helped the Maroons move in front 6-4 in the third game. The home team then rallied and a kill by Cassidy Vaughn gave Bowie a 17-10 lead. A big kill by Haley Bianco helped the Lady Dawgs take the third game 25-18.

In the third game, serves from Maya Fisher and Bianco propelled Bowie to a 10-6 advantage. Fisher’s assist on a Vaughn kill put the Lady Dawgs on top 12-7. Fisher later set up Jamie Ludwig for a kill, as Bowie continued to battle back and win the third game 25-18. An ace by Blake tied the intense contest 3-3 in the fifth and final game.

Wes Sigmon smashed an ace and then set up Brodnox for a kill that put the visitors in front 6-5. The crowd, split in the middle, drowned each other out with half yelling “Let’s go Austin!” and half cheering “Let’s go Bowie!” With Jayme Witek serving, Bowie built an 11-10 lead before Austin High—what went up didn’t come down—errantly launched the ball into the rafters for good following a Lady Dawg point.

After officials located a new ball, Rachel Salinas set up Cassidy for a kill that tied the game 12-12. Overesch then made a phenomenal play with a dig and speedy kill afterward to move the Lady Maroons in front 14-12. Despite a valiant attempt at a play, Bowie hit the ball into the net later, giving Austin High a 15-13 triumph. “I was pretty fatigued in this hot gym,” Overesch said following the victory. “It was a challenge getting through Bowie.”
