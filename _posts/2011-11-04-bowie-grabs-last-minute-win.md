With a brisk breeze at his back, Bowie QB Robbie Dickey threw a game-winning touchdown to Mac McGarah with 39 seconds remaining on the clock in a clutch win Thursday night for the Bulldogs over the Anderson Trojans.

</div>“It was a big night for the seniors at their last home game,” the towering receiver said. “You’ve got to give credit to Dickey. It was a great pass.”

Avenging identical 25-20 defeats each of the past two seasons to the Trojans, Bowie bounced Anderson 18-14 on a breezy night at Burger Stadium to set up a showdown for the District 15-5A championship Friday at Westlake. “I thought it was a good game,” coach Jeff Ables said. “The wind obviously was a factor. I was proud of our guys shutting them out in the second half.”

Anderson gave the home team Bulldogs (6-3, 4-0) an early 2-0 lead on their initial possession of the game when the center snapped the ball over the Trojan quarterback and through the end zone. Behind linemen Jacob McAngus, Bryce Lester, Ryan Taylor, Robert Quintero and Will Hopkins, the Bowie offense embarked on a six-play drive that culminated with a wind aided 45-yard field goal by Call Casarez.

In the second quarter, Anderson (5-4, 2-2) took the lead on a short rushing touchdown, and later extended the advantage to 14-5 with another touchdown run. Working into a strong wind, Bowie operated a no-huddle attack in the third period before fumbling the ball to the visitors. Quarterback Robbie Dickey eventually connected with Bryson Hoskins for a long pass play, then Dontae Harris took a direct snap and bolted across the goal line.

Running back Gino Jonassaint went to work in the fourth quarter moving the chains with rushing success behind blocks by Nick Harrison. The junior running back finished the night with 124 yards on 20 carries. “All I knew to do was play for my teammates and the seniors,” said Jonassaint. “That’s what made me run so hard.”

Trailing 14-12, the Bulldog defense stepped up and gave Dickey and crew one final possession. “The crowd pumped us up,” sophomore cornerback Pedro Garcia said after making five total tackles in his first varsity game. “We persevered and won. I owe it all to my teammates.” Jeremy Jackson led the red and black with eleven stops.

After visiting Westlake (7-2, 4-0), Bowie will face either Round Rock or Westwood in bi-district playoffs next weekend.
