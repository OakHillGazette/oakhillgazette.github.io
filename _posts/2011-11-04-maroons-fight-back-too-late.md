Del Valle 48, Austin High 38

Unable to overcome a barrage of four touchdowns surrendered in the second quarter, Austin High (1-8, 1-3) fell to Del Valle 48-38 Thursday night at House Park. The Maroons must now defeat Anderson (5-4, 2-2) and hope Akins (0-8, 0-4) slips past Del Valle (1-8, 1-3) to have a chance at earning a playoff spot.

Jaylen Alfaro put the visitors on the board first with a 30-yard scoring run before Cayleb Jones caught a scoring strike from quarterback Michael Clawson who returned to action after suffering a back injury earlier in the season. Linus Boley’s outstanding tackle on third down forced Del Valle to punt later, and the Austin High offense embarked on a quick scoring drive.

Clawson first hit Cayleb Jones for a 15-yard reception and then connected with Isaiah Jones for a 32-yard pass play. After finding Cayleb Jones on a crossing pattern over the middle, Clawson dove into the end zone to give Austin the lead. Clawson located Sid Martin in the back of the end zone for a successful two-point conversion to put the home team Maroons in front 14-7.

Xxavier Holman scored twice on rushing attempts, and the Cardinals connected on a pair of long pass plays in the devastating second period to take a 34-14 lead into the half. In the third quarter, Quince Reese had a nice rushing play and Clawson completed a pass to Cayleb Jones before running for a first down. Clawson scrambled to the right and found Isaiah Jones at the goal line for an aerial touchdown cutting the Del Valle lead to 34-21.

</div>A touchdown throw to Cayleb Jones was brought back shortly afterward due to an ineligible man downfield infraction. Del Valle then intercepted a Clawson throw to terminate another Maroon scoring opportunity. The Maroons were granted a safety when the Cardinal deep snapper lofted the ball over the punter’s head and through the end zone. Clawson’s 24-yard scoring dash after rolling left and sprinting to the right helped reduce the Cardinal lead to 34-31.

Alfaro threw a touchdown to Chris Campbell and Holman barreled across the goal line in the fourth quarter to extend the Del Vale advantage. A Clawson scoring pass to Isaiah Jones after scrambling to the right completed the Maroon offensive output for the evening.
