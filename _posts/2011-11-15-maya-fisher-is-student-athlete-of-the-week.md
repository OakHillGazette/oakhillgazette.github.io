Gazette athlete of the week Maya Fisher

by Patrick Olson

Maya Fisher’s consistent ability to set up the Lady Dawgs’ outside hitters helped the Bowie volleyball team earn another trip to the playoffs in 2011. “She finished off the last half of the year doing a great job of setting,” coach Jason Landers said. Fisher finished the season accumulating nearly half of the team’s assists, with 510.

A native of Austin, Maya attended Cowan Elementary before advancing to Covington Middle School where she also ran track. Upon arriving at Bowie, Fisher focused on volleyball, honing her skills at the setter spot while on the freshman and junior varsity clubs. During the summer, she played at the club level on the Austin Juniors AJV traveling to Orlando, Dallas and Houston with good friend Samantha Gonzalez who shined for the Crockett volleyball team.

Spanish instructor Mrs. Petmecky is Maya’s favorite teacher at Bowie. “She’s been there through my ups and downs,” Fisher said. “She’s like a second mom at school…not only a teacher, but a friend.” Fisher’s favorite academic experience occurred when she completed Spanish III as a junior. Earning a second-game win at Westlake in a 19-25, 27-25, 13-25, 12-25 defeat to the Lady Chaps ranks as her best athletic moment. “We hadn’t won a single game against them in a long time,” Fisher noted.

The youngest of three girls born to Greg and Frances Fisher, Maya says her mother is the most positive influence in her life. “She’s been my number one fan supporting me in anything I do,” she said. “Stay focused and keep your grades up because school comes first,” Fisher replied when asked what advice she may have for younger students aspiring to play varsity athletics at Bowie.
