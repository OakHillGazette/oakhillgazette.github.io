The Austin High boys’ basketball team continued to improve last weekend as the Maroons recorded three victories and sustained one defeat at the Lake Travis Tournament. “Our chemistry is good and the players are good at their roles,” coach Andy Dudney said. “They are going out, executing and playing to their strengths.”

Despite an early 9 a.m. tip, Austin High took to the court with energy to defend their tournament title in a 66-51 triumph over Belton. “From the start they were ready to go,” the coach said of his players. “It was a complete four quarters.” Westwood then topped the Maroons 89-78 as Patrick Strake led Austin High with 30 points.

Dorian Parks and Matt Jones both had good games in a 47-32 win over Waco Midway. Chris Moore contributed 21 points in the contest that saw the Maroons build a 15-5 advantage at the close of the first period. “He shot the ball extremely well,” Dudney said of the 5’10” sophomore point guard. Parks added 14 points for the Maroons.

Strake’s powerful presence in the paint helped Austin High earn a 64-53 win over St. Anthony. “They are a worthy opponent,” the Maroons coach said of the San Antonio

squad. “I was very impressed with their team.” Moore and Strake were named to the all-tournament team. On Tuesday at 6:30 p.m., a banner will be unveiled in the Roosevelt C. Nivens Gymnasium to honor last year’s district title team before a home game against Marble Falls.
