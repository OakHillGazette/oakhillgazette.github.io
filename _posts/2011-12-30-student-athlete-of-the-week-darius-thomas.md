Having been a varsity athlete since his sophomore year, senior Darius Thomas has had a busy schedule at Crockett High School. He plays football during the fall, competes on the basketball court in winter and runs track in the spring. “He is a really hard worker,” Cougar boys’ basketball coach John Morgan said. “He’s well like by his peers and teachers as well.”

Born in Austin, Darius attended Cunningham Elementary before advancing to Covington Middle School where he played basketball, football and ran track. As a sophomore, he earned a spot on the varsity football team for the final three games and joined the team for a playoff game. His favorite sports memory was an interception last September versus Caldwell. “They threw it up and I jumped up and grabbed it,” he explained.

Ms. Barnard is Thomas’ favorite teacher at Crockett. “She’s always supported me and pushed me to work harder in class,” the senior stated. Alfredo Rodriguez, a grandfather of Darius, provided a positive influence for the young man. “He’s always helped me and guided me,” Thomas added. “He always tells me encouraging things.”

Thomas wisely enrolled in a core class this past summer to get ahead academically. “I’m happy I took government and economics in the summer,” he cheerfully said. Darius has important advice for younger pupils aspiring to play varsity athletics at Crockett. “Play as much as you can to work on your craft,” he noted. “Stay up on your grades and have fun doing it at all times.” Following graduation, Darius would like to pursue a career in kineseology or physical therapy.
