Working at the point guard spot, Justice Rochell dishes out assists offensively and accumulates multiple steals on the defensive end. “She’s been taking care of business in the classroom, and she’s really improved her game from her junior year to her senior year,” Crockett girls’ basketball coach Jennifer Shuttlesworth said.

A native of Austin, Rochell attended elementary school in Del Valle before enrolling at Bedichek Middle School where she also ran track. Since arriving at Crockett, she has continued to compete at track meets in the spring, running relays and the 200-meter dash. The eldest of two children born to Johnny and Tammy Justice, Rochell hopes to be a coach in the future. Rochell’s younger brother Johnny is a sophomore at Crockett and also plays basketball, providing her with a sibling rivalry on the court.

Justice and her teammates suffered a 55-40 defeat at San Marcos Tuesday evening, but the veteran court general intends to help guide the brown and gold to the playoffs. “We have to keep working hard and play good defense,” she replied when asked what it will take for Crockett to get into the postseason.
