Alyssa Serna steps up her game in the second semester at Austin High School. She brings defensive tenacity to the basketball team during the winter and when spring arrives, she shines on the softball diamond.

“She has fire and she’s feisty,” basketball coach Tricia Johnson said. “She’s very quick and relentless. On defense, she doesn’t let you breathe.” Born in Austin, Alyssa attended St. Mary’s while in elementary school and moved up to O’Henry Middle School later, where she also played volleyball and ran track.

Upon arriving at Austin High, Serna earned a spot on the varsity softball club as a freshman and has been a three-year starter on the girls’ basketball team. “I have more fun in basketball but softball is my main sport,” she noted. Her older brother Pauly played basketball and baseball at Austin High and recently earned a spot on the North Texas basketball team. “He’s my role model,” the younger sibling said.

The youngest of two children born to Alex and Bertha Serna, Alyssa aims to attend Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi. Her favorite teacher at Austin High is Mr. Grayson. “He always pushed me and helped me do my best,” Serna said. Alyssa’s favorite academic accomplishment was in an important medical subject. “I aced my A&amp;P (Anatomy and Physiology) test,” she proudly stated.

“You only live once so give it your all,” Serna replied when asked what advice she may have for current O’Henry students hoping to play varsity athletics at Austin High. In addition to basketball and softball, Alyssa is also a member of FCA and the multi-cultural club at Austin High.
