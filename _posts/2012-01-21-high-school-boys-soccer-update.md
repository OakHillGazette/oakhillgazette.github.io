**Austin High boys’ soccer**

Following a 3-2 setback to Georgetown, the Austin High boys’ soccer team recorded wins over Beaumont Westbrook, Round Rock and New Braunfels Canyon. The three victories equal the team’s total wins for last season.

“Team play has been positive,” coach Howard Guttmann said. “We still need to improve fitness.” Guttmann will rely on Diego Solis, Andrew Schimberg and sophomore Jake Hiebert for offensive production this year. Colin Ashorn, Jorge Romero and goal tender Ayaz Husain will bring defensive tenacity to the crew. The Maroons hope to improve on a fifth place finish in district last year. Tony Fabela, Zach Kraatz, Romero and Hiebert serve as team captains.

Brandon Cramer and Zach Kratz bring physicality to the club after spending the fall semester on the Maroons football team. The Maroons now venture north to a tournament in Round Rock facing Belton at 3 p.m. on Thursday and Connally at 10 a.m. on Friday. Austin High also plays Stony Point Friday at 4 p.m.

**Bowie boys’ soccer**

A strong performance at the Governor’s Cup last weekend in Georgetown has the Bowie boys’ soccer club striving to achieve the success of the 2011 Bulldogs that reached the regional quarterfinals. “We have to practice hard, everybody has to stay in shape and make good decisions,” said senior Ryan Forotanrod when asked what it will take for the team to emulate last year’s club.

Call Casarez, Jonas Olson, Jordan Schroeder and Forotanrad provide coach Sam Miller with a talented set of offensive players. The black and red defense is led by Brendan Smith, Justin Rawson, Dillion Rodriquez and Josh Eurers. Sam Lisheron and Andres Martinez alternate time in the goal.

“Our strength is in the midfield,” Miller explained. “We have three very talented players in Call, Ryan and Jonas.” The coach is looking for players to step up and claim the starting spots on the wings and outside midfield. “We have no returners at those positions but we do have some talented players fighting for the spots,” he added.

Bowie opened the new campaign with a 4-1 victory at Dripping Springs. Forotanrod, Jordan Schroder, Casarez and Nikaan Moezzi scored in the win over the Tigers. The Bulldogs then took down Georgetown 4-1 with Forotanrod, Moezzi, Olson and Michael Munden putting the ball in the net. Bowie beat Conroe 2-1 and Lake Travis 2-1 but lost to The Woodlands 1-0 at the Governor’s Cup.

**Crockett soccer**

Both the Crockett boys’ and girls’ soccer teams posted wins over Eastside Memorial Tuesday evening to open district competition on the right foot. The Cougar boys’ club bested Memorial 3-2 while the girls’ squad smashed Memorial 6-0. “We played really well,” girls’ coach Ruben Botello said.

Coach David Dupont will now led the boys’ team into a pair of non-district encounters. On Friday, the brown and gold crew trek south to face San Marcos at 7:45 p.m. Bowie visits the Cougars on Monday at 7:45 p.m.

Stephanie Rodriguez recorded her third hat trick of the young season Monday night with Adrianna Becerra, Jarely Salinas and Jessica Zaragoza scoring the other Lady Cougar goals. Crockett will now visit McCallum for their second district game. Action is set to begin at House Park at 6 p.m.
