During his senior year at Bowie, Travis Bloomfield enjoys both helping younger students and bringing outstanding defense to the Bulldog soccer team. “Travis is a great student leader,” coach Sam Miller said. “He is a dedicated senior who has been in the program for four years.”

Born in Mesa, Arizona, Travis spent time in Korea, Malaysia and Japan before enrolling at Mills Elementary in the third grade. He progressed to Small Middle School where he also played football, basketball and ran track. Since his freshman year, he has played soccer during the spring and run cross country in the fall. “The main reason I ran cross country was to stay in shape for soccer but I enjoyed it, so I kept doing it,” Bloomfield said.

Contemporary issues instructor Mr. Ellerbrock is Bloomfield’s favorite teacher at Bowie. “He leads a unique class,” the midfielder said. “We talk about current events.” Travis fondly enjoys his PALS (Peer Assistance Leadership Strategies) class where students spend time mentoring elementary pupils. “For thirty minutes each day, we try to be an example to them,” Bloomfield said. “It’s a really great class. I love it.”

“I play offense and defense,” Travis said of his soccer duties. “I make sure the defense is locked down and on breakaways, I sprint back to make sure they don’t score.”

Bloomfield’s favorite athletic experience at Bowie occurred last year when Call Casarez scored the winning goal in a playoff game with two seconds remaining. Travis now hopes to experience a new favorite moment on the field as Bowie aims for another postseason appearance.
