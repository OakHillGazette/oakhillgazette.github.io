**Wicked at Bass Concert Hall**

In 2009, the Tony Award-winning musical *Wicked* sold out in record time when it came to Austin; but theater fans will have another chance to catch one of Broadway’s biggest hits starting this weekend.

This spectacular show tells the story of the witches of Oz, before Dorothy showed up.

“The two witches, \[played by\] Anne Brummel and Tiffany Haas are so incredibly talented, and to see two young ladies carry a show that way is rare in the musical theater,” says David Nathan Perlow, who plays the role of Fiyero in this production.

Inspired by some of the themes in the play, the production has teamed up with the National School Climate Center to help create an anti-bullying campaign in schools across the country.

“It is a story about accepting people for who they are on the inside, not being distracted by what you may see on the outside, and we can all relate to that I think,” says Perlow.

The show runs through Feb. 12 and tickets are available through broadwayacrossamerica.com/Austin or by calling 477-6060.

**Next to Normal at Zach Theatre**

The Washington Post called this show, “the future of American musicals!” That superlative is further supported by the Broadway production’s multiple Tony Awards in 2009.

The play revolves around what seems to be a “normal” American family, struggling with the matriarch’s crippling case of bipolar disorder. It features a thrilling contemporary score amidst the turmoil that the family has to face.

This production will be on stage at Zach through March 4 and tickets can be purchased at zachtheatre.org or by calling 476-0541, x1.

**Austin SAG Awards Party to Benefit TXMPA**

For any Austinites who believe they really belong in Hollywood, this event is sure to be the highlight of the weekend. To honor the many Texas performers nominated by the Screen Actors Guild, industry pros gather for contests, cocktails and live-streaming hook-ups to parties in Houston and Dallas.

Best of all, it’s open to the public and all attendees have a chance to shine as they walk the red carpet. The event will also feature a live viewing of the actual awards show.

The party starts at 5:30 p.m. on Sunday, Jan. 29 with a pre-show mixer at 501 North I35 (ND at 501 Studios). Seats are available to reserve at txmpa.org and the dress code is of course “red carpet ready.”
