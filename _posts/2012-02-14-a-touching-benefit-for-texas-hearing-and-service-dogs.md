Stay N Play Pet Ranch announced a Canine Touch fundraiser on Saturday, March 10, 2012. For just a $20 donation to Texas Hearing and Service Dogs, your dog can enjoy a Canine Touch demo from Stay N Play’s resident Canine Touch practitioner Donna Burrow, while you learn the benefits of this relaxing, healing technique for dogs. The “come and go” benefit will be held from 9AM – 4PM at the Texas Hearing and Service Dogs campus at 4925 Bell Springs Road in Dripping Springs.

Canine Touch is a series of gentle, hands-on moves that helps your dog relax, and encourages the body to heal and restore. This non-invasive technique is helpful for sick or injured dogs as well as working dogs, service and therapy dogs, athletic dogs, puppies and aged dogs. Your dog will feel better and, thanks to your donation to Texas Hearing and Service Dogs, so will you. *– submitted*
