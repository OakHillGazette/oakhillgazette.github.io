</div>Connecting on 19 of 27 shots at the foul line, McNeil dealt Austin High a 65-55 defeat in the first round of the Class 5A Region II playoffs Tuesday evening. Austin High (16-10) competes a successful season with a roster void of seniors while the Mavericks move forward to face Humble Kingwood in the next round. Chris Moore led the Maroons with 16 points.

The McNeil defense collapsed on Patrick Strake in the first quarter denying the 6’5” Maroon post offensive production. Isaiah Stewart and Winzel Sterling each scored four points in the first period, but the Mavericks led 18-10 entering the second quarter. Consecutive baskets and a free throw by Strake cut the McNeil advantage to 22-17. Strake had seven points in the second period but the home team led 27-22 at the half.

Cole Carper drove baseline and delivered a reverse layup to cut the Maverick lead to 29-24 in the third quarter. After Dorian Parks drained a three pointer, McNeil quickly countered with a trey. The Mavericks stalled as the final period began with extensive passing and consistently successful shooting. Moore nailed a three point shot in the corner but the Mavericks secured the victory with lethal points at the charity stripe.
