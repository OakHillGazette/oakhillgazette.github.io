**Austin High softball**

With ace pitcher Vern Garcia having graduated, the Austin High softball team will rely on Vanessa Castro to perform on the mound for the Lady Maroons. Castro helped Austin High earned victories over Shoemaker and Leander at the AISD Tournament last weekend. “This year’s team consists of a great group of young ladies,” coach Elizabeth Wissel said. “I am looking forward to our season and seeing what we can do out on the field.”

The Lady Maroons finished 26-6 last year with a strong performance in the playoffs. To prepare for the regular season, Austin High scrimmaged Rouse, Canyon, Hays and Lockhart. Wissel’s warriors compete at the Round Rock Tournament this weekend before venturing south to take on Dripping Springs on Tuesday. Austin High opens district competition on March 20th versus Akins at Garrison Field.

**Bowie softball**

The Bowie softball team opened the 2012 season with wins over Hays, Leander and McCallum. Jayme Perez drove in five runs at the plate and limited the Rebels to a single earned run with a solid pitching performance in a 9-3 win over Hays. Heather Newkirk scored three runs in a 6-4 victory over the Lady Lions. The Bowie bats blasted a dozen hits in a 24-1 destruction of McCallum.

Coach Cathy Johnson-Landers’ crew jumped out to an early 3-0 lead over the Lady Rebels with Maddie Lionberger smashing a home run. Catcher McKenzie Cain had a pair of hits and two RBI. The Lady Dawgs crossed the plate four times in the sixth as Perez added a home run.

Newkirk coaxed a base on balls to open the Leander game for Bowie. A double by Perez brought Newkirk home. Bowie put three runs on the board in the third inning as Newkirk walked again and Lauren Gfroerer followed with a single. After a walk by Perez, Cain singled home Newkirk. Gfroerer scored on a sacrifice by Bianca Van Vlerah. Lexi Grimaldo later scored on an error by the Lady Lions. Perez delivered insurance runs with a two-out, two RBI single in the fourth frame.

**Crockett softball**

A mere three games into the new season, Sharon Montgomery is quite fond of her 2012 Crockett softball crew. “Our strength is they are all good kids with great attitudes and they work extremely hard. The team chemistry is really good.” the skipper stated. The brown and gold squad lost to Rouse 18-2, beat Reagan 22-0 and suffered a 14-1 setback to Akins to open the new campaign.

The Lady Cougars feature veterans up the middle with seniors Alexis Gomez and Vanessa Hernandez working at second base and shortstop respectively, while Angela Reece roams in centerfield. Junior Casey Bailey returns for her third season on the varsity club operating at catcher. Montgomery is currently trying to find capable competitors in left and right field.

After developing two new pitches and working on her endurance, Victoria Murphy returns to serve as the team’s primary pitcher. Meghan Elmore, in her second year on the varsity team, works at third base. Freshman Raven Isoline-Webb and junior Katy Sheppard are competing for the starting first base role. Isoline-Webb can also work at catcher.
