**Bowie junior Ryan Smith (#44) drives to the basket for a reverse layup in Bowie’s earlier playoff win against Round Rock.**

<div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_2583" style="width: 229px">![](http://oakhillgazette.cloudioweb.com/files/2012/02/eBHS21-219x300.jpg)Bowie senior Paul Baxter (#21) leaps for the net in the Bulldogs' 58 to 50 first round playoff victory over Round Rock on Tuesday night. Bowie lost to Dekaney on Friday in Brenham.

</div>Dekaney dealt Bowie a 57-43 defeat in the second round of the Class 5A playoffs in Brenham Friday night. “They are the most athletic team we faced all year,” coach Celester Collier said. The Wildcats terminated a Bulldog postseason run for the second straight year.  
Collier’s crew cut the Dekaney lead to six points entering the final quarter, but the Bulldogs lacked an additional offensive threat to complement forward Mareik Isom and point guard Paul Baxter who combined for 34 points. “They put a lot of pressure on Baxter and Isom,” the coach added. “Dekaney is a hard matchup. They shoot the ball well, and they were red hot.”
