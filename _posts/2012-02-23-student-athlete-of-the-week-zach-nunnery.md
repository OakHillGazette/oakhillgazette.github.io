As the Bowie backcourt lit up the scoreboard, Zach Nunnery brought rebounding prowess to the frontcourt of the district champion Bulldog basketball team. “He’s really been going to the boards and rebounding the ball well,” coach Celester Collier said. “Zach is a solid student and does a great job in the classroom. He’s been providing a spark for us.”

Born in Santa Clara, California, Zach moved to Austin at an early age and attended Kiker Elementary before moving up to Bailey Middle School where he also played football. Upon arriving at Bowie, he played football as a freshman but concentrated on basketball after earning a spot on the varsity squad as a sophomore.

Street law instructor Mrs. Maney is Zach’s favorite teacher at Bowie. “Her lessons are fun and easy to relate to,” the 6’3” junior forward said. Performing well in an Advanced Placement class is Nunnery’s favorite academic accomplishment at Bowie. “I’m doing pretty well in AP U.S. History,” he said. Following graduation, Zach hopes to pursue a degree in sports medicine or physical therapy.

Following a sophomore campaign in which he focused on shooting, Nunnery has moved closer to the rim for rebounding work this season. He missed a stretch of five contests with a sprained ankle sustained at a tournament in Waco. “I came down on someone’s foot,” he noted. “But I got back in time for district.”

Nunnery’s favorite athletic achievement occurred when the Bulldogs successfully avenged an earlier defeat to a rival. “Beating Westlake after we lost to them the first time was nice,” he said. Nunnery had nine points in Tuesday’s win over Round Rock and now hopes to record a new favorite athletic experience as the black and red attempt to earn another playoff win versus Dekaney in Brenham on Friday.
