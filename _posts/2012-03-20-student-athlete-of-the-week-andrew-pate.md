Following an impressive sophomore pitching campaign, Andrew Pate earned the starting catching position for the Austin High baseball team. “After he pitched well last year, I told him we needed a catcher,” coach Glenn Bacak said. “He’s stepped up and is doing both and he’s a really good student.”

Born in Austin, Andrew attended Casis Elementary before advancing to O’Henry Middle School where he also played defensive back on the football team. After playing freshman football, he focused exclusively on baseball beginning as a sophomore. His favorite athletic moment occurred last year. “On JV 1, I threw a complete game versus Lake Travis to put us in the championship game at the Vista Ridge Tournament,” the versatile junior recalled.

An Eagle Scout and a member of the National Honor Society, Andrew says making good grades in geometry class has been his best academic achievement. Computer class instructor Kevin Robinson is Pate’s favorite teacher at Austin High. “His class in the most fun to be in,” he said. The eldest child born to Stewart and Gaye Pate, Andrew has a younger brother playing on the Maroon freshman baseball team.

Over the summer and during the fall, Andrew refined his throwing and catching skills on the club team Austin Wings. Pate earned victories this year in starting roles versus Friendship and El Paso Coronado and appeared in relief against Crockett and McCallum. He offers important advice for younger pupils aspiring to play varsity baseball while in high school: “Work hard at as many positions as you can because they need as many utility players as possible,” he stated. “And work a lot on your pitching.”
