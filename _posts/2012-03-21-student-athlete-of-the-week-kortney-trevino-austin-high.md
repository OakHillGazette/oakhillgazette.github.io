As the Austin High girls’ soccer team closes out the regular season with a playoff spot in reach, Kortney Trevino continues to excel at the last line of defense. “Kortney is very confident and that affects the team positively,” coach Deena Telley said. “She knows when to come out of the goal.” Trevino has recorded four shutouts this season.

Born in Austin, Kortney attended Cowan Elementary before moving up to Clint Small Middle School, where she also played basketball and ran track. Her favorite teacher is English I instructor Mrs. Ault. “She’s a really cool teacher that got me interested in what we were learning even though it was kind of boring,” the junior goal tender said.

Kortney’s favorite sports memory occurred last year when Austin High beat a fierce rival. “When we beat Westlake, it was really awesome,” she said.

Trevino earned a spot on the varsity team as a sophomore and honed her skills over the summer with select team Lone Star, competing with friends Gigi Privitera and Amanda Marquette from Bowie. She suffered a fractured wrist last year and had to miss six weeks. Kortney lists Telley as a positive influence in her life. “She’s always been supportive of me,” Trevino noted. The Maroons goalie, with 54 saves of 66 shots on goal, is set to protect the net as Austin High takes on Del Valle Wednesday and Anderson Friday night at Nelson Field.

A member of the National Honor Society, Kortney also serves as the sports editor for the Austin High yearbook. Her favorite academic memory was when she was a freshman and ranked ninth in her class. Following graduation, Trevino would like to continue her athletic career while majoring in English. “Stick with it,” she replied when asked what advice she had for younger pupils. “Sometimes it can be hard to get on varsity. Know you are good enough and keep on top of your studies. No pass no play.”
