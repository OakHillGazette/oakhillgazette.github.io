With four straight wins, the Bowie baseball team has moved into second place in District 15-5A. Following Friday’s 3-0 victory over Austin High, the Bulldogs face Anderson for first in district and host Westlake on Thursday at Burger Field. First pitch versus the Chaparrals is set to be thrown at 5 p.m.

Robbie Dickey took the mound for coach Rudy Alvarez against the Maroons last Friday. Keeping the pitches low, Dickey brought a live fastball to the game that struck out Austin High designated hitter Haden Hunt in the bottom of the second to thwart an early Maroon scoring threat. Hunt reached base later via a walk, but Dickey fanned three Austin High hitters to end the inning en route to tossing a one-hitter.

The Bulldogs scored once in third inning, after a brilliant bunt single by Gable Whitacre sparked the Bowie offense. After taking second via a wild Maroon throw to first, Zach Poehl smashed a double to right centerfield to plate Whitacre. Bowie added a pair of insurance runs in the fifth frame courtesy of a second extra base hit in the game from Eddie Flores.
