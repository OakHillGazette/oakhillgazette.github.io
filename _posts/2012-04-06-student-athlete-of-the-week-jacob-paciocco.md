While on the baseball diamond, Jacob Paciocco fields the critical shortstop position and hits in the important third spot in the lineup. Academically, he is enrolled in three Advanced Placement courses.

“Jacob has been a good student athlete since the day he walked into Crockett High School,” said Cougar baseball skipper Miguel Trevino. “Jacob is a wonderful young man that can do anything he wants to do. Very proud and honored to be his coach.”

After attending Sunset Valley Elementary, Jacob advanced to Fulmore Middle School where he also played football and basketball. Although he played little league baseball with Greater East Austin, he recalls facing Oak Hill teams. “It was a rivalry basically,” he said.

The first of three children born to Daniel and Judy Paciocco, Jacob enjoys supporting the athletic endeavors of his younger sisters Jordan and Jianna who play volleyball and softball respectively. “I coached my little sister’s softball team in the Oak Hill Youth Sports Association,” the brown and gold infielder said.

Pre-calculus instructor Mrs. Nookala is Paciocco’s favorite teacher at Crockett. “She’s the loudest cheering teacher out there,” Jacob noted. Over the summer, Paciocco improved his game while playing for select team Action Baseball, with trips to games in Houston, Atlanta and Kissimmee, Florida. Getting a hit off Action Baseball teammate Ryan Johnson in the playoffs last year versus Cedar Park ranks as Paciocco’s favorite athletic moment. “He’s one of my best friends. He also struck me out the next two times I faced him.” Jacob admitted.
