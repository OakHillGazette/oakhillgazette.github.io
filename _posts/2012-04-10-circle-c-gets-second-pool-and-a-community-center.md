Circle C has recently opened a new community center at 7817 La Crosse Boulevard with a pool and 5,800 square foot multi-purpose community building. Located on 7.5 acres shaded by 250 native trees, the facility has been in the planning stages since 2009, when Phoenix Holdings Ltd. donated the site to the Circle C Homeowners Association (CCHOA).

Pool use will be limited to Circle C residents and guests, but rental of the community building is available to the general public as well as residents.

Jason Bram, president of CCHOA, said, “It is very gratifying to see the transformation of raw land into a facility that will so greatly enhance the Circle C community.”

The pool’s spiraling slide and splash pads provides a mini-version of recreation found at water parks. Also included are outdoor showers and changing rooms, a pool office and picnic areas. Circle C resident Clayton Griffis was happy to hear that the pool opens on May 1 because it’s within biking distance for his two sons.

CCHOA manager Denise Nordstrom has been involved in the project from beginning and has helped supervise the process. She said, “The Community Center has exceeded our expectations. It is exciting to see the Center open and ready for users after almost two years of project management. The feedback from our visitors has been extremely positive and we are looking forward to all of the great events that can be hosted here.”

In the community center building, a large meeting room can be partitioned into three rooms as needed. A catering kitchen is also available. Nordstrom envisions uses that include birthday parties, baby showers, community meetings and weddings.

Russ Hodes, a CCHOA director, said, “I think it’s an important contribution to the community and it’s a much bigger project than anyone every expected.” He said the project was always part of the Circle C Master Plan, but when the project was taken on by the HOA instead of the developer, the result was much more attractive.

Hodes added, “This is huge for Southwest Austin, which lacks meeting spaces normally found in churches and large restaurants, which are very limited in our suburban corner of Austin.”

Said Bram, “I appreciate the time and efforts of my fellow board members, the CCHOA management and our design team for their dedication to the project, and the high quality result of these combined efforts. We would also like extend our thanks and congratulations to the committee of residents who worked on the design concept for over a year. Overall, it has been a great effort from a lot of talented people who freely gave their time for the benefit of the entire community.”

Added Hodes, “We believe that this community center brings Circle C Ranch back to the top of the most desirable places to live in Austin, being close in, with the best ranked schools in Austin, two child daycare centers, a graduate college, and local shopping that includes the Waterloo Ice House and the new Alamo Drafthouse.”
