Showcasing dedication and determination, Bowie’s Trisha Christmas won the 100-meter dash at the District 15-5A meet, and will now compete in the Class 5A Region II meet this weekend in Waco. Trisha experienced her most memorable athletic moment as a freshman, when she captured third in district on the junior varsity track team at Bowie. “She has improved so much this year,” coach Rita Gonzalez said.

Christmas attended Covington Middle School where she also played in the band. Over the summer she attended a track camp at Florida State, and ran competitively for the club team Central Texas Elite at a meet in San Antonio. The Seminoles camp and training, based on what she was taught by Olympic silver medalist David Patrick, assisted in her development as a sprinter. Trisha recorded her best time of the season with a 12.3 in a 100-meter race at the South Austin Relays three weeks ago at Burger Stadium. Christmas signed a letter of intent for a scholarship to run for Butler Community College in Kansas.

U.S. History instructor Thomas Johnson is Trisha’s favorite teacher at Bowie. “He’s really enthusiastic,” she said. “He’s really nice.” Her best academic achievement was in a chemistry class when she got an A on a test. Trisha’s younger sister Andrea runs track and plays basketball. Christmas will also run with Bowie’s 4×200 regional qualifying relay team that includes Belize Garza, Christian Grizzle and anchor Rene Maldanado at the Waco event. “Work hard and keep winning in your view,” she replied when asked what advice she may have for younger pupils aspiring to compete at the varsity level in high school.
