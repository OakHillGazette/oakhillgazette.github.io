Having earned a playoff spot for the thirteenth consecutive season, the Bowie baseball team now faces a formidable foe in the first round of the postseason. “We are proud of being in the playoffs,” Bulldog boss Rudy Alvarez said. Bowie (17-12-1, 8-7) advances to a bi-district showdown with a Round Rock (21-9, 14-3) club that captured the District 16-5A title.

Starting Bulldog pitchers Robbie Dickey and Kurt Clark will attempt to contain a Dragon offense that averaged over thirteen runs per game in their final four regular season contests. Colton Turner delivered three doubles in Round Rock’s 17-4 destruction of Westwood and smashed a three-run home run in the Dragon’s 11-1 defeat of Pflugerville. The black and red attack will counter with freshman Joe Davis who blasted a home run and a triple in a 12-0 obliteration of Del Valle, and Jonathan Ramirez who had a double and three RBI in an 11-1 victory over Akins.

Turner combines with 6’3” southpaw Cole Doherty to form an imposing Dragon duo of starting pitchers. Senior outfielder Blake Montag, who had a three run home run game versus Westwood, represents an additional offensive threat for the Dragons. Bowie ventures north to face Round Rock in the first game at 7:30 on Thursday before hosting the Dragons Friday evening at Burger at 7:30 p.m. If necessary, game three will be played at Round Rock with the first pitch set for 2 p.m.
