After finishing third in district, the Austin High baseball team must take on Georgetown (23-4-1, 14-4) in a best-of-three game series that begins Thursday evening at Burger Field. “I am so proud of this team for the way they competed and worked all year long,” said Maroons coach Glenn Bacak. “It is a really special group of young people who put team success ahead of anything else. They really enjoy playing together.”

Anderson snapped a seven game winning streak for the Maroons with 4-0 victory over Austin High (17-10-1, 10-5) in the final regular season contest for both schools. Starting pitcher Travis Eckert sustained only his third loss of the season, and the Maroons committed three errors in the field to assist the District 15-5A champion Trojans.

The Georgetown Eagles won their first eight games of the season, including a 9-1 triumph over the Maroons at a tournament encounter in early March. The Austin High pitching staff must contain Sam McDowell and Cameron White, who combined for five RBI in the Eagle’s third victory of the year. Greg Salinas took the hill for the Maroons in the first battle between the two clubs, surrendering a pair of hits to Eagle first baseman Tyler Watson.

Georgetown, coached by Danny Wallace, features a pitching staff that includes Jarrett Dooley, Joe Hauser, Jako Kelm and Watson. The Eagles finished third in District 16-5A, one game behind champion Round Rock. Bacak may opt to start five game winner Andrew Pate in the first game of the series, and throw Maroon ace Eckert in Friday’s contest at Georgetown. First pitch for the initial two games is set for 7:30 p.m. If necessary, game three will commence at 4 p.m. on Saturday at Burger.
