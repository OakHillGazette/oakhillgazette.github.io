Jake Fowler, a native Oak Hillian, is used to success. While a student at Kiker Elementary School, he earned a black belt in karate at the age of 10. He was part of the James Bowie High School Outdoor Performing Ensemble when the band won the Blue Cross Blue Shield Fiesta Bowl National Band Championship in 2005.

So when he graduated from TCU in 2011 with a degree in Economics, Jake had every expectation of quickly finding a suitable job and career. Said his mom, Deb Erlanson, “He anticipated that earning a bachelor’s degree from a quality Texas private university would put him in a good position to be readily employable. The downturned economic situation has been a barrier.”

Jake invested in a resumé service to help him find something suitable, but that investment has yet to pan out. But Jake has been busy. Deb said, “He tried his hand at a sales job and soon found out that’s not the line of work for him. He has accepted temporary work to be productive, earn income, and have the potential of a full-time job offering. He wants responsibility, to feel a sense of accomplishment, to earn a salary and benefits. Getting the degree was great! Not getting a job he’d like to do is lousy.”

Jake decided to take action, and at the ripe old age of 24 Jake was not too proud to seek advice from his dad, Doug, a local firefighter. Jake said, “Dad said he would lend me his yard tools and thinks I should start mowing again.” Jake worked part-time for a lawn service company when he was in high school.

Doug believes this presents a unique opportunity for his son. He said, “It will be a great opportunity to put into practice those principles he learned in the classroom.” He added, “You only have to go into any Walmart or HEB to see that economic times are tough – you see fewer young people working the cash register.”

With equipment provided by his dad and advertising supplied by his mom and his aunt, Jake has started the Student Loan Payment Lawn Care, providing mowing, edging and refuse removal services. No need to ask what he’ll be doing with his income – the title says it all.

The recent rainfall means growing grass that will need to be mowed soon. To help a starving graduate, contact Jake at 512-653-0687.
