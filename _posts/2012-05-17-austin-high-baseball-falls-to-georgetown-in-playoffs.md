The Austin High baseball team encountered a formidable foe in a bi-district showdown versus Georgetown, as the Eagles swept the Maroons with a 3-1 win on Thursday and a 10-2 victory on Saturday. After finishing third in District 15-5A, Austin High (17-12-1) will lose five seniors to graduation.

The versatile Tourville recorded 36 hits in 30 games and played third base, second base and in the outfield.

Finally, Kel Casto and Chris Bacak concluded their high school baseball careers and will attend the University of Texas in September. “Kel is a great student and a valuable senior leader who pitched, played first base and was sometimes our designated hitter,” the coach added. “Chris helped hold things together for me for four years and is in the top ten of his class academically.”
