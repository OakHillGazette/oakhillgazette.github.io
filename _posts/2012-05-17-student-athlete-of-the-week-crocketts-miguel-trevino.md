Joseph Mata recently completed his senior season on the Crockett baseball team earning unanimous first team all-district honors. “He has matured into a fine young man,” Cougar coach Miguel Trevino said. “He has integrity and a love for the game of baseball.”

Born in Austin, Joseph attended elementary school in Jacksonville, Texas before enrolling at Bedichek Middle School where he also played football and ran track. Upon arriving at Crockett, he played football and baseball until his junior year when he focused on baseball exclusively. As a senior, he returned to the football team to play running back. His favorite athletic moment was as a sophomore when he hit for the cycle—recording a home run, two triples, a double and a single during a 23-22 win over McCallum.

English instructor Ms. Barnard is Joseph’s favorite teacher at Crockett. “She’s at every single football game,” he recalled. “She cheers her heart out.” Joseph’s older brother Carlos Sturrock played football and baseball for the brown and gold, and his younger brother Abraham plays football and tennis at Crockett. Mata achieved his favorite academic accomplishment this year in an AP-Calculus class. “I worked hard the entire year and ended up making all 90’s,” he said.

Following graduation, Joseph may join the Marines or attend Texas State University where he has already been accepted. “I want to play baseball and major in mathematics,” Mata added. Trevino has been a positive influence in Joseph’s life. “He has made sure I’m going on the right path to being a man,” Mata said. Over the summer, Joseph improved his baseball skills on the select team JET with Austin High players JL Tourville and Greg Salinas.

“Stay motivated even through harsh times,” Mata replied when asked if he had advice for younger pupils aspiring to play varsity athletics at Crockett. “Problems occur but you have to overcome them.”
