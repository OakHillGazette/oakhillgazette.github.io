**Jayme Perez (#18) continues to lead Bowie with consistent pitching and a powerful presence at the plate.**

*By Patrick Olson*

The Bowie softball team disposed of McNeil 5-3 in the first round of the playoffs, and will now face Klein Collins in an area playoff game at Bryan Friday night at 7 p.m. If the Lady Dawgs prevail, they will take on the winner of the Westlake/Oak Ridge playoff series in the third round. Jayme Perez continues to lead Bowie with consistent pitching and a powerful presence at the plate.

After McNeil built an early 1-0 lead with a two-out RBI single in the top of the second inning, Bowie rebounded with a pair of runs in the bottom of the third. Heather Newkirk led off with a single to centerfield and Ashli Lotz delivered a bunt single. A double to center by Maddie Lionberger plated Newkirk and McKenzie Cane later doubled home Lionberger.

Bowie crossed the plate three more times in the fourth frame when Lionberger blasted a home run. The Dawgs delivered thirteen hits in the victory, with Lotz finishing a perfect four for four at the plate. “The kids did well,” coach Cathie Johnson-Landers said afterward. “We lost 3-1 to them earlier in the year. We learned from that game and built on it. We worked on our defense.”
