Austin–Oak Hill Rotary Club recognized officers of the Oak Hill Elementary Student Council, its faculty sponsor, and parent liaison for a highly successful 2011-2012 year. Under Dr. Linda Mitchell’s leadership, counselor Candi Caporal sponsored the Student Council this year as it took on the added duties of being a Rotary Early Act club.

Early Act is a Rotary effort to stimulate “Service Above Self” leadership among elementary age students. All Student Council members received Rotary’s Four-Way Test cards to help guide them in their daily and volunteer activities. At the conclusion of the monthly Student Council/Early Act meetings, the students recited the Four-Way Test. Kay Landry and Tom Cripps served as Rotary co-Liasons to the Council/Early Actors.

To qualify as an Early Act club, members must carry out volunteer helping projects within the school, in the broader community, and in the world. Oak Hill completed the Giving Tree to bring 11 needy families donated gifts from more fortunate, generous families at the school. The givers remained anonymous.

The Student Council/Early Act chose to cleanup Patton Ranch Road. They were designated that responsibility through the COA Keep Austin Beautiful Adopt a Street program. Two cleanup days were held this Spring. Finally, an International project was chosen with the assistance of the Rotary Club. Non-perishable School Supplies were collected during April. The supplies will be delivered to students of the Carlos Conseco elementary school in Matamoros, Mexico, during May, by members of the Matamoros Sur Rotary Club.

At its regular meeting Thursday, May 3<sup>rd</sup>, Austin-Oak Hill Rotary presented recognition plaques to Candi Caporal, parent Geeta Suggs, and the four officers of the Student Council. Calvin Suggs served as President, Sarah Latham as Vice-President, Kael Suggs – Treasurer, and Claire Meyer – Secretary. All are Fifth graders. A total of 47 Third, Fourth, and Fifth graders comprised the full Council.
