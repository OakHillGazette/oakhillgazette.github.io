Klein Collins (30-4) concluded the Bowie softball team’s season with an 8-5 victory over the Lady Dawgs en route to the state tournament last weekend. Bowie (20-8) finishes a successful 2012 campaign that featured a third place finish in district and a first round 5-3 playoff win over Round Rock McNeil. On Sunday, June 6th, the team held their annual banquet at Creekside Pavillion.

Collins put a pair of runs on the board in the first inning of the second round playoff game in Brenham, as the second and fourth Tiger hitters earned walks. Jayme Perez initiated the Bowie offense in the third inning with a triple. Holly Molenaar entered the game as a pinch runner for Perez before scoring the Dawgs’ first run on a single by Breanna Sepeda.

Bowie added another run in the fourth frame as Maddie Lionberger laced a triple and scored on a fielders’ choice by Molenaar. Collins exploded for six runs in the fourth inning, as three more Tiger batters coaxed bases on balls. Lionberger finished the day with a pair of runs and two hits.

Down 8-2, Bowie mounted a furious rally in the seventh inning, with Heather Newkirk, Ashli Lotz and Lionberger all reaching base via singles. Newkirk scored on a fielder’s choice and a single by Bianca Van Vlerah plated Lotz. A single from McCain scored Lionberger.
