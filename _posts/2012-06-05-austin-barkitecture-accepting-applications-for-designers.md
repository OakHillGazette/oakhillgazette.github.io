Animal Lovers of Austin, Inc., present Barkitecture, 2012. On November 10 from 12-4 pm in the spectacular 2ND Street District, Barkitecture will raise funds via silent auction of unique, one of a kind doghouses created by Austinâ€™s best architects, designers, and builders. Proceeds will benefit local area animal rescue groups.

Barkitecture is now accepting applications through their website, www.austinbarkitecture.com, from builders, designers, and architects who would like to be part of the event. In 2011, we had over 20 homes submitted and raised over $20,000.

This dog-centric afternoon will be filled with activities that include a silent auction, a Lofty Dog Howl-o-ween Fashound Show, vendor booths, pet adoptions, and a Designer Pup Stop where attendees are invited to play with their pets. Barkitecture is pet and family-friendly and free to the public.
