Summer is the season to adopt from the Austin Animal Center, which will be reducing its adoption fees for all animals to $20 for the month of June.

This reduced fee includes the animal’s spay or neuter surgery, vaccinations, microchip, and identification tags.

The Austin Animal Center currently has a record amount of dogs and cats in their care, with over 600 animals being cared for at the shelter, and over 500 more receiving temporary care in foster homes.

Many of these animals came to the center as very young puppies and kittens, and are now old enough for adoption. The Center is now ready to find a loving home for each and every one of them.

“There’s never been a better time to adopt,” stated Abigail Smith, Chief Animal Services Officer, “with so many healthy and adoptable animals in our care, we know we can find everyone a perfect match for their home.”

This reduced fee applies to all animals ready for adoption at the Austin Animal Center, and is waived altogether for animals over the age of five.

Despite the unseasonal influx of animals coming into the shelter, the Center has been able to maintain a live outcome rate at or over 90% for every month this year. The Center attributes much of this live outcome success to their adoption program and the collective efforts of their rescue partners, who work to ensure a live outcome rate for every adoptable animal that enters the shelter.

All pets available for adoption or lost pets can be viewed at www.austinanimalcenter.org.

Both shelter locations are open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily. For more information go to www.austinanimalcenter.org, call 3-1-1, or visit www.facebook.com/austinanimalservices for daily animal updates.

About Austin Animal Services

Austin Animal Services runs the largest animal shelter in Central Texas, providing shelter to more than 23,000 animals each year and animal control services to all of Austin and Travis County.

The Animal Center is an open-intake facility where stray and owned animals from Travis County in need of shelter are accepted regardless of age, health or species.

Austin Animal Center achieved a 91 percent live animal outcome rate for 2011 making the City of Austin officially a no-kill city. The City’s Austin Animal Center opened in November 2011 and operates at capacity daily and continues to focus on the no-kill equation which consists of animal adoptions and fostering; volunteer support; spay/neutering of pets in the community; tagging and micro-chipping owned pets; and a continued effort to work closely with all of its partners and the community to keep Austin a no-kill city.

Additionally, to help save animal lives, the City of Austin entered into a temporary license agreement with Austin’s Pets Alive!, a non-profit animal rescue group, to operate the former shelter, Town Lake Animal Center, 1156 W. Cesar Chavez St., as an adoption site for City shelter animals that are at risk of euthanasia. The TLAC facility is open daily from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
