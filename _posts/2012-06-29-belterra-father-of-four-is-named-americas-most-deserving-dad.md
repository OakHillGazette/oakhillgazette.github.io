**The Drummond family’s submitted video for “America’s Most Deserving Dad”**

*By Ann Fowler*

Northwest Florida’s Emerald Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau spent 13 weeks searching for America’s Most Deserving Dad. On Father’s Day they found him – in Belterra.

Firefighter John Drummond, father of four, had his mind on a family dinner at the Salt Lick when someone knocked on his door. Nicole Scott, Public Relations and Multimedia Marketing Coordinator for Emerald Coast, had come to Southwest Austin to present him with the title of “America’s Most Deserving Dad.”

Drummond was speechless at hearing the news.

The contest required submission of a video limited to a length of 1 minute – explaining why the nominee deserved the honor. Said Scott, “We had over 5,000 applicants. There were over 180 videos submitted – and you won, my dear,” she told Drummond.

</div>Scott added, “Your efforts for your family, your efforts to this wonderful community — you put your life on the line every day — and on behalf of America, this family, and Emerald Coast Convention and Visitor’s Bureau, I would like to thank you for your dedicated service, your time, your life and now … you get to play.”

Along with the title comes a 2012 Jeep Wrangler — fully loaded, according to Scott — a one-week stay in a luxurious Destin beach house courtesy of ResortQuest, a $500 spending spree to Destin Commons, and round-trip airfare. The Jeep is ready to be picked up in Florida.

“I’ve never won anything,” said Drummond, pointing out that his car had more than 100,000 miles. In fact, said Ana, he’s never owned a new car.

“He’s the awesomest,” said 8-year-old Joseph, who helped his sisters Maya, 6, and Layla, 4, plus baby brother Tyler, 1-1/2, make the video — with the assistance of his mom Ana.

Asked why she submitted the video, Ana said, “Well, John’s been working really hard for us. I’ve gone back to school to become a nurse. He’s worked a ton of overtime so I wouldn’t have to work and could focus on school. He’s obviously paying for school. I just felt like he really deserved it. He works a lot. He works really hard. And he’s a great father. There isn’t anything he wouldn’t do for his children and with his children. If they want to play he’s already ready to go. He’s just a great dad and we’re really proud of him.”

Ana said their first video attempt came in at 1 minute and 45 seconds. She said, “I come from an accounting background so I’m very particular about the details. So I made sure I was following the rules. I felt like it was really important to mention as many things as we could he really truly does for us on a daily basis.”

Drummond knew of the contest’s existence only because he helped Ana upload it. Facebook voters chose the top ten, and an Emerald Coast committee selected the winner.

</div>An Emerald Coast representative called Ana with the news days before the presentation, but she was sworn to secrecy until the presentation at 6 p.m. “She’s pretty good about keeping a secret,” said Drummond.

The 33-year-old firefighter works at Station 37 at Highway 71 and Covered Bridge in Oak Hill. He and Ana have been married for nine years. Drummond works extra shifts so his wife could quit her job to concentrate on her classes. He cares for the children while she’s in school. Ana said, “He’s an amazing father. I felt like he deserved it.”

Drummond said his son, Joseph, has been asking to go fishing since he was 3. Now he’ll get his chance.
