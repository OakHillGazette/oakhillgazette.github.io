In June of next year, construction will begin on a "continuous flow intersection" at SH 71 and William Cannon Blvd.'

This fall, a string of improvements is moving forward at the Y at Oak Hill to provide five to seven years of mobility enhancements and traffic relief.

Among the short term projects, additional left turn lanes at Convict Hill Road and RM 1826 will improve traffic flow and will begin construction around the New Year.

In June 2013, construction will begin on a “continuous flow intersection” at SH 71 and William Cannon Blvd.

Joe Tanner Lane will also be re-configured to improve operations as part of that project.

Known in engineering communities as “CFI,” the design moves the left turn down the road, eliminating the left-turn traffic signal phase. (See above TxDOT animation of how the lanes will work at the Y at Oak Hill.)

The City of Austin is contributing $4 million to the project, while the state provided $2.7 million and Travis County provided $1.5 million, according to TxDOT.

Austin’s contribution is funded by the 2010 Mobility Bond. It is a signal that the city takes regional collaboration and addressing Austin’s growing transportation challenges seriously, said ATD Director Robert Spillar.
