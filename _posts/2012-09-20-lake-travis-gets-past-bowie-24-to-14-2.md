Shutout in the second half, Bowie (2-4, 0-2) fell to Lake Travis 24-14 Friday night at Burger Stadium. The Cavaliers erased a 14-7 deficit at intermission with two touchdowns and a field goal en route to their second straight district triumph. The Bulldogs face Austin High (1-4, 0-1) next Friday at House Park with kick off set for 7:30 p.m. Lake Travis (5-1, 2-0) hosts Akins.

Lake Travis opened the scoring in the contest with a 32-yard scoring run on first down after Bowie jumped off sides on fourth and five. Bryson Hoskins scored Bowie’s first touchdown sprinting around to the right and crossing the goal line with 11:28 remaining in the second quarter. A snap by Dominic Arocha preceded a hold by Jordan Gilman before Caleb Garza split the uprights to tie the game 7-7.

Bowie offensive lineman Keith McAlonan, Jacob McAngus, Andrew Alvarado, Clayton Law and Albert Betts cleared a path and sophomore Cole Myers raced 59-yards into the end zone to give the home team a 13- 7 advantage. Garza’s extra point made it 14-7. Defensively, Bowie defensive back Person Oliver made a terrific play on a quick throw to a Cav wide-out, and linebacker Zach Kanz made an outstanding stop for the Bulldogs on a Lake Travis fourth down play. Running back Varshaun Nixon scored twice in the second half for the visitors and Kevin Marcotte added a 26-yard field goal for Lake Travis.
