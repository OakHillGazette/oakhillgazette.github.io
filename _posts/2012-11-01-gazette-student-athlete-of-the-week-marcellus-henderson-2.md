Student Athlete of the Week Macellus Henderson

Wreaking havoc for the Cougar defense, Marcellus Henderson brings his A game every week for the Crockett football team. “Marcellus is an outstanding athlete who has dedicated himself to getting better every day,” coach John Waugh said. “He takes that same attitude into the classroom and has excelled scholastically as well.”

A native of Austin, Marcellus attended Barton Hills Elementary before moving up to Covington Middle School, where he also played basketball and ran track. After competing at the Texas Relays last April, he is focused on earning a trip to the state track meet next spring as a discus thrower. “I want to earn a scholarship either playing football or throwing the discus,” he added. “I want to pursue a degree in sports medicine. I would like to stay around sports the rest of my life.”

English instructor Ms. Bernard is Henderson’s favorite teacher at Crockett. “She has helped me since my freshman year,” he noted. Earning all A’s in a six weeks period ranks as Henderson’s favorite academic moment. Marcellus’ fondest athletic memory is, when as a sophomore, he made the second team all-district as a punter and a linebacker.
