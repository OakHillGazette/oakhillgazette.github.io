Two defensive touchdowns in the third quarter propelled Bowie to a 27-17 bi-district victory over Round Rock Friday night at Burger Stadium.

“It was a good defensive effort,” said Preston Miller, who scored Bowie’s last touchdown on a pick six interception return for a score. Bowie (7-4) moves into the area round to face Spring Westfield (11-0) next Saturday at 2 p.m. in Brenham.

Quarterback Austin Eschenburg began Bowie’s second possession with a five-yard run and tossed a 53-yard scoring strike to John Subia on second down to give Bowie an early lead. Running behind a mammoth offensive line, Dragon running back Deandre Story scored the first Round Rock touchdown on a 10-yard sprint into the end zone. Following a missed field goal by Bowie as time expired in the second quarter, the game remained tied 7-7 at the half.

The Bulldogs began the second half with a three and out; but Bowie defenders Dontae Harris, Camara Capel and Zach Kanz made fine plays on the other end of the field forcing the Dragons to punt. Bowie then embarked on a long drive that culminated with a 27-yard field goal by Caleb Garza.

On the subsequent Round Rock possession, Bowie defensive back Logan Martin showcased outstanding football IQ, turning a slow developing Dragon play into a defensive score for the home team. “I read what their receivers were talking about,” Logan explained. “They were gonna run a tunnel (screen) underneath. I don’t think they had everything down. They ran into each other, and I went and got it.”

Fifty-one seconds later, Preston Oliver intercepted another Dragon throw and took it to the house with a minute and a half left in the third period. “I just saw the ball go into the air and made a play,” the junior defensive back said. Story scored again on a 32-yard run less than a minute into the fourth quarter, but the Dragons failed on the point after touchdown.

Garza gave the Bulldogs insurance points on a 36-yard field goal with Nick Ferris snapping and Jordan Gilman holding. Excellent pass defense by Capel and Oliver kept the Dragons from scoring again. “I am really proud of the way our kids fought,” coach Jeff Ables said afterward. “Round Rock is a good football team.”

Eschenburg led the red and black offense with productive runs and accurate throws. “That was a tough one,” the junior field general said. “The offensive line gave us push. It was a good team effort.” Linemen Keith McAlonan, Clayton Law, Dominic Arocha, Andrew Alvarado and Jacob McAngus cleared paths for Eschenburg all night.
