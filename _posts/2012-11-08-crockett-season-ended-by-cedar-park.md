Cedar Park crushed Crockett’s playoff run 65-7 Thursday night at Gupton Stadium, with a powerful defense that swarmed the Cougar offensive skill position players. Crockett (3-7, 2-3) completed their season, while Cedar Park (9-2, 6-0) advanced to face the winner of Saturday’s contest between Kerville Tivy and San Antonio Jefferson in the second round of the Class 4A Division II playoffs.

A fumbled snap by quarterback Nicholas Azurdia put the Cougars in an early hole during their initial possession. Azurdia then threw to Nikko Tamez for eight yards and quickly hit Justin Miller for a five-yard gain. Brown and gold offensive linemen Jonathan Santiago, Dominic Rodriguez, Austin Hinojosa, Edwin Dominguez and Adrian Davila contained the Timberwolves pass rushers, but the Cedar Park linebackers quickly pounced on the Cougar receivers. Marcellus Henderson proceeded to punt under pressure.

Chris Hutchings scored first for Cedar Park on a 10-yard run. Later on third and two, Hutchings sped around the left end and cruised over the goal line on a 30-yard sprint. Mikal Wilson added another rushing touchdown for the Wolves before Cedar Park recorded a pick six, taking an interception into the end zone.

After Cedar Park led 42-0 at intermission, Miller scored on a 14-yard run for Crockett in the third quarter. Henry Aviles converted the extra point. Henderson again displayed tremendous defense at the linebacker spot for the Cougars but they had to punt seven times. Miller finished the night with 50 yards on 18 carries.
