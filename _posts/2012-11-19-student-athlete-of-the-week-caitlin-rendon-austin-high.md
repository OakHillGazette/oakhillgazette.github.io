After missing every district game last year while recovering from an elbow injury, Caitlin Rendon is glad the Austin High girls’ basketball season is underway. “Caitlin has been on the varsity since the middle of her sophomore year,” coach Tricia Johnson said of her 6’0” center. “She is a hard worker on and off the court. She listens, executes, is a leader by her example.”

Born in Austin, Caitlin attended Patton Elementary before advancing to Small Middle School, where she also played volleyball. Upon arriving at Austin High, Rendon played volleyball as a freshman before focusing exclusively on basketball. Her first varsity game remains her favorite athletic experience at Austin High. Rendon hopes to return to the high level of play she displayed during the 2010-11 season. “I can feel myself trusting myself and trusting my teammates,” she said. “I’ve really worked hard on my recovery and am excited for the season.”

Rendon honed her hoops skills in the off-season playing on the road in Frisco and San Antonio for the select team The Next Level Cats with teammates Macy Lozen and Lexi Evans. The youngest of three girls born to Michael and Tracie Rendon, Caitlin says her mother is her most positive influence. “She goes to almost every one of my games,“ the senior post stated. “She’s always there for me.” Caitlin also has important advice for younger pupils aspiring to play varsity basketball at the high school level. “Work hard on your fundamentals,” she noted. “Being able to dribble and shoot well really helps you excel in the future.”
