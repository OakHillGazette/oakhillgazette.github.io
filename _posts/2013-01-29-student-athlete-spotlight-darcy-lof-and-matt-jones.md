As guard for the Crockett girls’ basketball team, Darcy Lof plays an important role for a Lady Cougar team intent on pressing defensively and scoring with multiple fast break opportunities. “Darcy has improved tremendously on the basketball court from the time she started our program as a freshman. Most of that can be attributed to her work ethic and internal drive for success,” coach Jennifer Shuttlesworth said. “She transfers that same drive for success to the classroom.”

Lof attended Boone Elementary before progressing to Covington Middle School, where she also played volleyball and ran track. Upon arriving at Crockett, Lof continued to participate in three sports, helping to guide the brown and gold volleyball team to the playoffs this past fall. Following completion of the basketball season, she will continue to compete in track and field in the 4 x 100, 200 and 400 events. Winning the district title in track and field last spring is still one of Lof’s favorite athletic achievements at Crockett.

Chemistry instructor Ms. Steele is Lof’s favorite teacher at Crockett. “She is very understanding and explains very well,” Lof said.

Lof’s work in the Crockett backcourt helped the Cougars capture a district-opening victory over Travis. “I help my team improve and try to have everyone involved,” the sophomore said.

Patterning his game after NBA stars Steve Nash and Chris Paul, Austin High point guard Matt Jones runs the Maroons basketball offense with efficiency. “Matt has an extremely high GPA and high basketball IQ,” coach Andy Dudney said. “He is like a coach on the floor.”

A native of Austin, Jones attended Patton Elementary before progressing to Small Middle School where he also played football and ran track. Following a freshman year when he played quarterback and receiver for the freshman football team, Jones focused on hoops exclusively. “Since I was real young, it has always been my goal to be the best point guard I could be,” he added.

Jones’ favorite teacher at Austin High is algebra instructor Mr. Kiker. “When we went on a field trip to Costa Rica, he applied the math class to real life scenarios,” said Jones. As a student in the Academy for Global Studies program, Jones enjoys learning how to be a global citizen.

Closing out a tournament title win over host school Lake Travis with eight straight successful free throws is currently Matt’s favorite athletic achievement at Austin High, although plenty of opportunities still exist for the junior court general to top that performance.
