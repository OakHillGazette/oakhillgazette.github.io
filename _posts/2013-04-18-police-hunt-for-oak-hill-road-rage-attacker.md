AUSTIN – A man who assaulted a truck driver in the parking lot of Jack Allen’s Kitchen on State Highway 71 was still being sought by police this week. Late Wednesday, Austin police released composite artist sketches of suspects involved in the incident.

The incident occurred at about 9 p.m. April 4, when the truck driver, driving a red Chevrolet Dually pulling a flatbed trailer, attempted to enter the parking lot at Jack Allen’s, 7720 West State Highway 71. Unable to negotiate the turn, the driver motioned to the car behind him, a white sports utility vehicle, to back up and give him room. Instead, according to the police report, a passenger in the SUV got out of the vehicle and “severely beat” the driver of the truck. The attacker then fled the scene, along with the SUV driver and a woman passenger in the back seat.

The truck driver was rushed to University Medical Center at Brackenridge Hospital with “life-threatening injuries.” Police declined to release his name, and his condition is not known.

Austin Police Detective James Kerby said the investigation has not progressed much. “I’m still working the case but we have no new leads.” Kerby said police are preparing a composite sketch of the assailant and will begin circulating it soon. Anyone who has information about the case should call Detective Kerby at (512) 974-5350.

The attacker is described as a white male in his late 20s, 5’10” tall, 240 pounds, with a bald or shaved head. He was last seen wearing blue jeans and a black jacket with red and white lettering on it.

The driver of the SUV is described as an elderly white male. An older white female was a passenger in the front seat of the SUV and a blonde white female was in the backseat of the SUV.
