The Shady Hollow Municipal Utility District (MUD) has scheduled the second of two public hearings for Tuesday, Sept. 3, to begin proceedings for the annexation of Shady Hollow by the city of Austin. The first meeting was held August 11 at the Shady Hollow Community Center.

The next meeting will be held at 6:30 p.m. at the Shady Hollow Municipal Utility District Office, 3910 Capistrano Trail.

Shady Hollow is a neighborhood of 1,623 homes that stretches east and west of Brodie Lane south of Slaughter Avenue. If the area is annexed, the neighborhood’s residents will become citizens of Austin, possibly by Dec. 31, 2020.

The purpose of the public hearings is to work out a Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) with the city of Austin. Ron Stried, president of the MUD, said the two parties have been in negotiation ever since the city announced its intention to annex Shady Hollow several months ago.

Austin always has had the option of annexing Shady Hollow within three years by placing Shady Hollow on its annexation plan. Development of a SPA would extend the date of annexation to 2020 to allow more time to ensure that residents receive the same level of services they are now receiving. Meanwhile, the MUD would turn over operations of its water and wastewater systems to the city on April 2, 2018.

The MUD would continue to provide other services, such as Constable’s patrols, fire protection and maintenance of drainage areas until 2020. After 2020, the city will provide all services, including police and fire protection, emergency medical services, solid waste, street and transportation services and drainage.

The city will not acquire or maintain any of Shady Hollow’s parks or recreational facilities, because these are owned by the Homeowners Association. After annexation, residents will have the right to vote in city elections and will be subject to pay city taxes.

The MUD will have the right to sell its office building on Capistrano Trail and use the proceeds for any authorized purpose.
