excerpt: "  The Austin Animal Center has more than 1,100 cats and dogs to care for, many of them lost from last week’s storms. The Center has taken in over 400 animals in the past 7 days, and only 132 of them have left the shelter. Anyone who is missing their pet should come to the Austin Animal Center to look for their pet, and check the Center’s website regularly. The Center also tweets every 30 minutes with information about stray animals that have just come into the shelter; follow @austinanimals.\n\n  Every summer the Center fills up with kittens and puppies. Storms and fireworks add to the problem by causing a surge in stray animals entering the already over capacity shelter. Sadly, many of these pets never find their way back home. “It never ceases to amaze me,” says Abigail Smith, Chief Animal Services Officer, “that so many healthy, well cared for pets arrive here and are never reclaimed. They are well groomed, and they have nice collars, but no id tag or microchip.”\n\n  The Austin Animal Center offers free microchips and tags to community members.   The Center is also running a summer adoption special with $25 adoptions that include spay/neuter surgery, vaccinations, microchip, collar and ID tag. The special will run through Sept. 1, 2014.\n\n   The Austin Animal Center, located at 7201 Levander Loop, is open daily 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Visit the website to view all lost pets and those available for adoption at austinanimalcenter.org or check facebook.com/austinanimalservices for daily animal updates."
