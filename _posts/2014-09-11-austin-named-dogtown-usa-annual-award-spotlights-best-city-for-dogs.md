This Saturday, September 13th, animal advocates from around Austin will participate in the Best Friends Animal Society’s 3rd Annual Strut Your Mutt fundraiser. Attendees are encouraged to raise funds for their favorite local animal welfare group, participate in a walk or run with their dogs, and join in a wide array of fun activities for the whole family.

Dog Fancy Magazine, the world’s most widely read dog magazine, will also be joining the event, recognizing Austin as the winner of DogTown USA 2014. Every year, Dog Fancy readers nominate an American city that represents to them the most dog-friendly accommodations. Dog Fancy editor Ernie Slone will be representing the publication to present a check for $5,000 to the City of Austin. The City will donate the winning prize money to their designated local dog charity Austin Pets Alive, one of the most accomplished No-Kill adoption centers in the United States.

“As America’s first large No-Kill city, it’s an honor to receive this recognition from Dog Fancy Magazine awarding Austin the title of being the best city for dogs and people who love them,” said Austin City Council Member Mike Martinez. “Years of dedication and hard work on behalf of the Austin Animal Center, Austin Pets Alive, and so many other valuable partner organizations and volunteers have helped us achieve our animal-welfare goals and fostered a pet-friendly environment citywide.”

Austin will be profiled in the September 2014 issue of Dog Fancy, which became available on newsstands in June. Strut Your Mutt is a free event on Saturday, September 13th at Muller Lake Park, located at 1829 Simond Avenue. Registration begins at 8am, and the presentation of the check will begin at 9am. The walk and run will follow at 9:30am with festivities continuing through 1pm. More information on the event can be found at StrutYourMutt.org.
