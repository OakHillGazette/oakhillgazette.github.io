February is “Love a Pet Month” at the Austin Animal Center. Beginning Feb. 1 and throughout the month the Animal Center is running adoption specials.

All pet adoptions will be $40. Pet adoptions include spay/neuter surgery, vaccination, tag and microchip, a value of more than $200 in services to help these pets stay healthy and safe.

Families are always welcome to visit the shelter and meet the many pets available for adoption.

On Feb. 14 love your pet and bring them to the Austin Animal Center for a free microchip to keep them secure and safe and pick up a free canvas tote bag.

Additionally, a special Love a Pet Month T-shirt will be available for a small donation.

On Feb. 21 from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. the Austin Animal Center will host a free rabies vaccination clinic. As required by Texas State law an owner or handler of a dog or cat must get the pet inoculated with the rabies vaccine.

Vaccinations are for dogs and cats 3 months of age and older. Puppies and kittens younger than 3 months will be provided free identification tags and registered in the Animal Center database so that they can be reunited with their owners if lost.

Dogs must be on a leash and cats must be in carriers or secured in boxes with air holes. Puppies should be brought in carriers or crates. For more information the public can call 3-1-1.

The Austin Animal Center is open daily from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. and is located at 7201 Levander Loop. Dogs are also available for adoption at our Town Lake Animal Center location from 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily. For more information about the Austin Animal Center, visit www.austinanimalcenter.org.
