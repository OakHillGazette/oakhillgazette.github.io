Customers can get a $3 discount at select The Home Depot® stores on Cree® LED Bulbs and continue saving for years once they install their bulbs at home.

Austin Energy is working with The Home Depot and lighting manufacturer Cree, Inc. to offer the $3 discount on six different types of Cree LED Bulbs. This point-of-sale discount offers savings of up to 40 percent per bulb. The price tag includes the discount so no coupons are needed and customers can purchase up to 12 Cree bulbs at a time. The discount is available for a limited time at the following five The Home Depot locations:

• Mueller Airport, 1200 Barbara Jordan Blvd, Suite 100

• North Austin, 10515 N. MoPac Expressway

• Sunset Valley, 1200 Home Depot Blvd.

• Southeast Austin, 3600 S. Interstate Highway 35

• Slaughter Lane, 8801 S. Interstate Highway 35

“This offer is another example of how Austin Energy is promoting the use of new and more efficient technologies to help customers save energy and reduce their electricity bills,” said Debbie Kimberly, Austin Energy Vice President of Customer Energy Solutions.

“This simple, point-of-sale discount puts the power in the customer’s hand to install and make the energy-efficiency improvement on their own without filling out forms, requiring coupons or waiting for a rebate to arrive in the mail,” Kimberly said.

LED bulbs offer more value than incandescent bulbs due to energy savings and much longer life. They use up to 90 percent less energy and last up to 25 times longer. Customers can use LED light bulbs the same way as incandescent bulbs. They offer the same brightness and work in most light fixtures.

Cree LED Bulbs are omnidirectional for better light distribution and dimmable with most standard dimmers. To ensure they are purchasing an energy-saving LED light bulb, customers should look for the ENERGY STAR® label on the package. These light bulbs have been independently certified and have undergone extensive testing to assure they will save energy as promised.

The efficiency of LEDs is becoming greater and their price continues to drop. The average efficiency of LEDs is close to 100 lumens (a measure of brightness) per watt, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That is higher than the typical efficiency of a compact fluorescent light bulb, which ranges from 55 to 70 lumens per watt. Although the initial purchase price is higher for more efficient technologies, significant savings are achieved over the life of the bulb.
