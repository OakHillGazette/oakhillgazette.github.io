It is imperative that we have an organization dedicated to tackling a broad range of issues that impact our pocketbooks, from property taxes, to utilities, to transportation, just to name a few. This committee provides a unique approach in that it will allow for 11 taxing entities in Travis County to coordinate efforts towards addressing this very serious and pressing issue.” The committee includes three appointees from the Austin City Council, two appointees from the Austin ISD, two appointees from the Travis County Commissioners Court, and one appointee from the Capital Metro Board of Directors, the Central Health Board of Directors, Del Valle ISD, Pflugerville ISD, Williamson County ISD, Round Rock ISD, and Leander ISD. Council Members Ellen Troxclair, Delia Garza, and Ann Kitchen have been appointed by resolution as the representatives from Austin City Council.

“For the average taxpayer, it is difficult to navigate all of these taxing entities and understand how the decisions of each affect our cost of living,” Troxclair continued. “This committee will allow for a broader perspective and a more effective approach to tackling our affordability issues. I thank Council Member Garza for sponsoring this resolution and look forward to serving with my colleagues on this critical Committee.”

The Regional Affordability Committee plans to hold public meetings, discuss specific issues relating to the cost of living, and develop policy recommendations for the governmental bodies.
