The Austin/Travis County Animal Services Office is asking the community to be alert and take precautionary measures with wildlife such as raccoons, skunks, coyotes, foxes and bats after a recent confirmed case of rabies.

Earlier this month, a raccoon was found in the southwestern Travis County in the Hamilton Pool Road area and tested positive for rabies. While no human interaction with this raccoon has been reported the City is asking the community to be vigilant with wildlife.

The City offers the following tips to protect pets and family of exposure to these wild animals:

Vaccinate your dogs and cats as well as livestock.

Restrain your pets. Do not allow them to roam freely in public.

Avoid contact with wild animals and unknown dogs and cats.

Do not touch sick or injured animals.

If your pet is bitten, scratched or in a fight with any animal, call 3-1-1.

Any contact with these high-risk wild animals should be reported to 3-1-1 immediately. Any sign of sick or dead wildlife should be reported to 3-1-1 as well.

The Animal Services Office will be conducting a free pet rabies vaccination clinic from 8 a.m. to noon on Saturday, May 16 at Richard Moya Park 10001 Burleson Road. More information about the clinic, here.
