**Resumes animal intake on Wednesday**

The Austin Animal Center has reopened today for adoptions, those reclaiming pets, and anyone wanting to help by fostering a pet from the shelter after temporarily closing to the public Monday due to weather conditions.

The Center will be waiving adoption fees today and Wednesday, May 26-27, as well on “reclaim fees” on all fixed animals.

Last night the Animal Center evacuated its Town Lake Animal Center after that facility flooded. The City sheltered approximately 60 dogs from there temporarily in the Austin Animal Center in East Austin at 7201 Levander Loop.

The water has subsided at TLAC and the shelter staff are in the process of taking the dogs back to the Town Lake Center at 1156 W. Cesar Chavez St. TLAC operates only as an overflow for kennel space for the Austin Animal Center. TLAC will be open today for adoptions only. However, residents who are missing a pet should go the Levander Loop location.

Due to the storms of the recent days the AAC is over capacity by approximately 54 dogs and will not be taking any lost or owner-surrendered pets. The AAC will reopen intake at 11 a.m. Wednesday, May 27.

The City is asking for people who find a lost dog or cat to keep the animals in a safe environment, call 3-1-1 to report the lost animal, and house the animal a few days before turning it into the shelter.

The Center also suggests those finding a lost pet to post fliers in the neighborhood and to walk the dog around the area to see if the pet is recognized by its owner. There are numerous websites available to create fliers such as www.petfbi.org or www.findfido.us.

Additionally, pet owners should make sure that pets are properly contained when the area is under a storm. The safest way to ensure that your animal doesn’t run off is to bring the pet inside during the inclement weather.

The Austin Animal Center offers free I.D. tags and microchips to all pet owners in the Austin and Travis County to help keep pets safe and out of the animal shelter system.

The Animal Center is open its regular hours, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily. Town Lake location is open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.
