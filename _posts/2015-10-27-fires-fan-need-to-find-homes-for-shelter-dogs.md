**Meet Homer (dog on left), Blue Dog Rescue’s 2000th rescued dog—shown here with his adopted family.**

*by Ann Fowler*

October has been national Adopt a Shelter Dog month, the brainchild of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) and the American Humane Association to encourage people to adopt rather than purchase pets. This observance is even more important now because of the recent Central Texas wildfires.

Austin shelters and rescue organizations took in evacuated adoptable animals from Bastrop, so it could create a safe haven for displaced pets from the wildfires—all animals will be held until they are reclaimed by their owners.

By mid October, more than 90 animals had been moved from Bastrop to Austin, making adoptions critical for the now overcrowded shelters. For people looking for new canine family members, this is a win-win situation as many organizations have lowered the adoption fees.

As the wildfires raged, Erica Thompson, Bastrop County Animal Services Office Director said, “At this time the Bastrop shelter is not in harm’s way so we could also use volunteer support to help walk dogs and assist with kennel cleaning.”

Tawny Hammond, Austin’s Chief Animal Services Officer, said, “We are glad to help our Bastrop County neighbors. We need the public’s help. Adopt in Austin to help Bastrop.”

Hammond added, “In time of crisis in our Central Texas region, we don’t hesitate to lend support to our neighbors. In 2011, the Austin Animal welfare community supported the relief effort with animals from Bastrop and we are happy to do so once again.”

**Meet Homer, Blue Dog’s 2000th rescued dog.**

Homer found his way to Blue Dog through the Bastrop County Animal Shelter where he resided for five long months. He was described as “a social butterfly” by the staff. Homer had demodex mange, a treatable, non-contagious skin condition usually brought on by stress and a weakened immune system, very common in young shelter dogs. Once in a safe home with his new foster family, medical treatment was started and Homer began improving quickly.

In basic dog training classes he excelled at learning and proudly graduated. He also became an ambassador for Blue Dog, attending as many events and festivities as possible. One of his favorites was hanging out with Spike, supporting the Round Rock Express and Blue Dog Rescue at Bark in the Park night. If there was a party, Homer was your dog. After 4 short months (according to his foster family), Homer found his forever home with an awesome forever family. He now has a real family with a real big brother, Gordy. His foster mom shared this update:

“In early July we were lucky enough to have Homer enter our lives! He is an amazingly happy little guy who loves to cuddle with his big dog brother, Gordy, chase birds in the yard, go for a run, or cuddle on the couch with the family. We knew it was going to be a perfect match the day that Homer crawled on top of Gordy in their now favorite chair and literally fell asleep on top of him. Gordy did not move-growl-bark but rather just looked at Homer and went back to sleep. They are truly two peas in a pod and we feel so blessed to have Homer as part of our family!”

October 2015 update: Homer now has a new little sister. She turned one year old this month. *– from Blue Dog Rescue*
