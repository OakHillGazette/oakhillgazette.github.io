OAK HILL – May is “Mental Health Month” and the Austin Chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) has a calendar of relevant events in the Austin area—and for the first time, in Oak Hill. From a screening of a movie about postpartum depression, to a live storytelling show, to a series of short documentaries from the Mental Health Channel made in partnership with KLRU and the Texas Tribune, there are a lot options that are sure to be insightful.

Considering the fact that 1 in 5 adults in this country live with some form of mental illness, there are few families that are not to some extent affected by mental illness. In any given year, more than 1 person out of 25 will suffer from a Serious Mental Illness (SMI), which will result in “serious functional impairment, which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities,” according to the National Institute of Mental Health. For people who are trying to come to grips with a family member’s diagnosis, the Austin chapter of NAMI has been offering free help in the form of support groups and classes. “Family-to-Family” is a 12-session program “designed to help family members understand and support loved ones living with mental illness, while maintaining their own well-being.” These classes are taught by family members experienced with having a loved one living with mental illness. For the first time ever, these classes will be offered in the Oak Hill area.

A 12-week session beginning June 6 will be held at St. Catherine of Sienna Catholic Church on Convict Hill Road. Sessions will last from 6:30 to 9 pm on Monday evenings and will convey the latest information on mental health disorders, including medications and side effects, current research on treatments, strategies for handling crises and guidance on locating services in the community. People can find out more and download a registration form at namiaustin.org or they can call Program Director Jessica Miller at 512-374-1335.
